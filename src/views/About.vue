      <p>The app intends showcase CRUD operations with an express REST api</p>
      <p>The idea is to list users in the database, mark the ones that have an "active" purchased train ticket, ie a ticket for a trip that has yet to happen and give the admin the possibility of editing or deleting each user.</p>
